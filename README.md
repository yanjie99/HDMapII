## üéØ Overview
We introduce **<span style="color:#ff7e5f">HDMapII</span>**, a novel approach to information interaction for connected autonomous vehicles empowered by high-definition maps. HDMapII consists of five main components: the **database** for HD map information management, the **information interaction modes** between autonomous driving vehicle and HD map, the **communication methods** for various types of dynamic information within HD map information database, the information **communication protocol** applied at different interaction modes and the approach to achieving a complete HD map information interaction process.

In the RoadRunner <span style="color:#A680B8">simulator</span>, HDMapII utilizes open-source map data, such as OpenStreetMap(OSM), to <span style="color:#EA6B66">rebuild real road environment</span> (including lane markings, curbs, surrounding built environment, etc.) and <span style="color:#EA6B66">generate HD map data</span> for storage in HD map information database. These scenario data are then used in <span style="color:#009600">different information interaction modes</span> respectively and allocated to the corresponding communication methods based on the characteristics of the information itself. Finally, in autonomous driving scenarios, all information interactions between autonomous vehicles and HD maps are conducted based on the <span style="color:#B46504">MQTT protocol</span>. As the process progresses, newly generated HD map data can be updated to the HD map information database for potential future interactions.
